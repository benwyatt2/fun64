Be sure to clone with submodules as the engine binaries live in a 
permanently orphaned branch. The recomended way to do this is to run this script after a simple clone.

	./git-init

The same also needs to be done when you pull updates, so remember to 
use the git pull script provided or your bin dir might get out of sync.

	./git-pull
